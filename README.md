Installing Gazebo
Gazebo Ubuntu packages
The easiest way of installing Gazebo is to use packages. There are two main repositories which host Gazebo packages: one is packages.ros.org and the other is packages.osrfoundation.org. At the time of writing:

packages.ros.org
ROS Melodic: Gazebo 9.x
ROS Noetic: Gazebo 11.x
ROS2 Foxy: Gazebo 11.x
ROS2 Rolling: Gazebo 11.x
packages.osrfoundation.org
gazebo 9.x series (package name gazebo9)
gazebo 11.x series (package name gazebo11)
This means that including the osrfoundation repository is not strictly needed to get the Gazebo Ubuntu package. It can be installed from the ros repository.
